    <!-- This is one way of writing . But not recommended as too many HTML and JS code together will make it unmanageable and messy. -->

      alert("hey!");

    <!-- So similar to CSS we can split the same to a JS file! -->
    <!-- <script src="app.js"></script> -->

    <!-- Why is it towards the end of the page? Because before the JS is loaded all the HTML elements are loaded. -->
